# FSTree App

The FSTree app is designed to efficiently manage and visualize file system trees. It provides a comprehensive view of the directory structure, allowing users to navigate and manipulate files and directories with ease.

## Unblocked Data Handling in Multi-threading

The app leverages Go's powerful goroutines to handle data processing in a multi-threaded environment. By using unblocked data handling techniques, the FSTree app ensures that operations are performed concurrently without causing bottlenecks or deadlocks. This approach maximizes performance and responsiveness, making it ideal for handling large file systems.

Key features include:
- Concurrent directory traversal
- Efficient file and directory operations
- Responsive UI updates
- Minimal resource contention

These features make the FSTree app a robust tool for managing complex file system structures in a performant and scalable manner.
